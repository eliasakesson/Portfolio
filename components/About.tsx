				I&apos;m a 18 year old developer from Sweden. I love to learn new things
				and develop new skills. I mostly focus on programming web applications,
				but I also do games, mobile- and desktop applications, electronics, and
				have been doing it since 2018. I&apos;m currently studying my last year
				of high school and will graduate in June 2024. I&apos;m looking for a
				job as a developer starting in summer 2024.
